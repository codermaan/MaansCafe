		<h1>Recipes - World's Best Scrambled Eggs</h1>
		<p>I adapted this recipe froma book called <i>Sydney Food</i> by Bill Graigner. Ever since tasting these eggs on my 1<sup>st</sup> visit to Bill's restaurant in Kings Cross Sydney, I have been after the recipe. I have since transformed it into what I really believe are the <i>best</i> scrambled eggs I have ever tasted.</p>
		<p>This recipe is what I call a 'very special breakfast', just look at the ingredients to see what it has to be tasted to be believed.</p>
		
		<h2>Ingredients</h2>
		<p>The following ingredients make one searving.</p>
		<ul><li> 2 eggs</li>
			<li>1 tablespoon of butter(10g)</li>
			<li>1/3 cup of cream(2 3/4 fl ounces)</li>
			<li>A pinch of salt</li>
			<li>Freshly milled black pepper</li>
			<li>Three fresh chives(chopped)</li>
		</ul>

		<h2>Instructions</h2>
		<ol><li>Whisk eggs, cream and salt in a bowl.</li>
			<li>Melt the butter in a non-stick pan over a high heat (taking care not to burn the butter).</li>	
			<li>Pour egg mixture into pan and wait until it starts settling around the edge of the pan(around 20 seconds).</li>
			<li>Using a wooden spatula, bring the mixture into the center as if it were an omelet and let it cook for another 20 seconds.</li>
			<li>Fold contents in again, leave for 20 seconds and repeat until the eggs are just done.</li>
			<li>Grind a light sprinkling of freshly milled pepper over the eggs and blend in some chopped fresh chives.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>You should only take a maximum of two servings per frying pan.</p>
